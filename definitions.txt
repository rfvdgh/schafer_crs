OBJECTS and CLASSES

Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, 
where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.
An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. 
Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. 
It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions 
we build the house. House is the object. As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create 
many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class and the process of creating 
this object is called instantiation.
