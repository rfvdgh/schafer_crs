First-Class Functions:
"A programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens."

First-CLass Citizen (Programming):
"A first-class citizen (sometimes called first-class objects) in a programming language is an entity which supports all the 
operations generally available to other entites. These oeprations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a
function, and assigned to a variable."

...What this means is we should be able to treat functions like any other object.
we can pass functions as arguments, return functions as the result of other functions
and we can assign functions to variables.
